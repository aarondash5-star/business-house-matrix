# Current Business House AI Matrix rollout status

**Date:** 2026-10-18

| Stage | State |
|---|---|
| Architecture | Approved: Open WebUI, LangGraph, Temporal, FastMCP/ContextForge, Ollama, PostgreSQL, EVOLUTION |
| GitHub migration | Complete: public `aarondash5-star/business-house-matrix`, original Git history preserved |
| CI / public-repository safety | Proposed in branch `ci/cloud-readiness-20261018`; verify PR checks before merging |
| Oracle Always Free | Target selected; tenancy, identity and capacity not yet verified |
| Google Cloud Run | Backup target selected; Matrix identity and free quota not yet verified |
| Open WebUI runtime | Not deployed |
| LangGraph | Starter simulation only; no live model or tools |
| Temporal / MCP | Planned, not connected |
| OpenClaw | Deferred until pilot acceptance |

Next exit gate: passing, reviewed GitHub validation checks. Next required external decision: which separately authorized cloud tenancy/project to use, and verify its actual free capacity before any deployment.
